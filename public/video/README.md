Place your video files here to be served by Vite's public directory.

- Example path for the Sleep page video: `/video/video1.mp4`
- To add the file, copy the MP4 into this folder and name it `video1.mp4`.

Notes:
- Files in `public/` are served at the root URL (e.g., `public/video/video1.mp4` -> `/video/video1.mp4`).
- Large video files can increase repository size. Consider hosting large media on a CDN or external storage and update the video `src` accordingly.
